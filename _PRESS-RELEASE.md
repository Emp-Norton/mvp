Ready Player 2
A match-making service for PC gamers.

The RP2 service provides a platform for PC gamers to find like-minded companions for their digital adventures. 


 Ready Player 2 is a match-making service for PC gamers which helps users find other gamers who they're likely to enjoy playing with, based on similarity of game library, console choice, and play-style. 

  As video games continue to focus more on the multiplayer and social aspects than solo gameplay, it becomes increasingly valuable to have a community of friends to play with. This is difficult for many PC gamers as it can be awkward to ask a total stranger 'Want to be friends?' and even if one musters up the courage, there's no guarantee that said person will have the same games, play style, or availability. 

  Ready Player 2 solves this problem by providing an easy-to-use platform for players to match with similar gamers.
